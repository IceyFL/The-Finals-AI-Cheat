This is a cheat currently Made for The Finals.
It is based off of https://github.com/Babyhamsta/Aimmy
It is currently undetected in the finals and possibly other EAC games.

A compiled version is available for free in my [discord](https://discord.gg/MpSKK9epc7)

If you are struggling to remake it for a seperate game join my discord and for $25 i can make the cheat work for a different game if you provide me with the .onnx file(you can find these in the aimmy discord server)
also for $50 i can do that and add a key system for you so you can sell it.
My discord user is @presidentelmo if you want to message me about this.

To use it you simply download this directory and then compile it as a release build in visual studio.

# How to Make your own

This app is made so you can easily modify it for your own use and different games.

1. You will want to replace load.onnx with another .onnx file you can find these online in places such as the Aimmy discord.
you need to ensure that the file is named load.onnx and that you have set it as an embedded file.
